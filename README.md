# Lunar3D
# Configuration and Macro Files


Description of project:
Lunar3d is a binder jet 3D printer created by UCF mechanical engineering students as a senior design project. The printer utilizes a modified Klipper configuration for operation and control of the printer. The inkjet cartridge is driven by the Inkshield project created by Nicholas C. Lewis. The team was able to achieve basic functionality of the printer itself, however Inksheild integration will require further development. Klipper configuration and basic macros are included in this repository with the goal of further development and refinement by other UCF students.
